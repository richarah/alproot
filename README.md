# infernal-env

A chroot+fakeroot env that may be brought up from nothing but wget, tar and a select few POSIX utilities.
Designed for use with infernal-docker, albeit easily repurposed for other tasks.

#### Please note

This is a work in progress. A lot is missing, and what isn't missing is in severe need of testing.
