# infernal-env

A chroot+fakeroot env that may be brought up from nothing but wget, tar and a select few POSIX utilities.
Designed for use with infernal-docker, albeit easily repurposed for other tasks.

#### Please note - WIP

This is a work in progress. A lot is missing, and the few features that aren't missing are untested and prone to break things.
