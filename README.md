# infernal-env

A chroot+fakeroot env that may be brought up from nothing but wget, an Internet connection and a select few POSIX utilities.
For use with infernal-docker, but may also be repurposed for other tasks.

#### Please note

This is a work in progress. A lot is missing, and what isn't missing is in severe need of testing.
